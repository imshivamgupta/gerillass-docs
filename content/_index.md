# Strongest Sass Toolkit ever!

Hi developers, designers and the other enthusiasts of the open-source community! 

I am proud to present to you a brand new toolkit for Sass: [**Gerillass**](https://gerillass.com/). It is an open-source toolkit that contains a set of Sass mixins to help you avoid code repetition and write better, faster and consistent CSS code.

## What is Gerillass?

Gerillass is a library built on top of [**Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)**](https://sass-lang.com/) to give you flexibility for your projects and accelerate your performance and creativity.

Many of the utilities that come with Gerillass are the solutions I have come up with for the challenges I have faced as a frontend developer over the years. These solutions have been shaped by the inspiration of other popular libraries and frameworks like [**Bourbon**](https://www.bourbon.io/), [**Scut**](https://davidtheclark.github.io/scut/), [**Compass**](http://compass-style.org/), [**Bootstrap**](https://getbootstrap.com/), etc. over time and helped me create Gerillass.

Hope you'll enjoy using it!
