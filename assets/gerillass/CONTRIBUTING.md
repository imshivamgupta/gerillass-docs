# Contributions 

Many of the utilities that come with Gerillass are the solutions I have come up with for the challenges I have faced as a frontend developer over the years.

And they have been shaped by the inspiration of other popular frameworks like Bourbon, Scut, Compass, Bootstrap, etc. over time and helped me create Gerillass.

So please share your solutions for the generic problems that you're facing and feel free to contribute to the library.
